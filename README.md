# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview: Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Launch Date & Goals

### The Purpose of this challenge was to examine the "Plays" subgcategory of this Kickstarter subset of data and discern any correlatable trends beased on the launch date and the intial goal.

## Analysis and Challenges: Sorting and Filtering the Data

### When dealing with large datasets such as this one, we first needed to set custom  filters and convert the raw data into more managable data by seperating our catergory and subcategory into new coloumns, and using a formula to convert our dates and extracting the year.

### Transforming the data allowed us to selectivley compare the "theater" data independently. By creating a pivot table, and filtering the data correctly, we saw a **higher** number of successful campaigns start in the middle of the year.
