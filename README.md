# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview: Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Launch Date & Goals

### The Purpose of this challenge was to examine the "Plays" subgcategory of this Kickstarter subset of data and discern any correlatable trends beased on the launch date and the intial goal.

## Analysis and Challenges: Sorting and Filtering the Data

### When dealing with large datasets such as this one, we first needed to set custom  filters and convert the raw data into more managable data by seperating our catergory and subcategory into new coloumns, and using a formula to convert our dates and extracting the year.

### Transforming the data allowed us to selectivley compare the "theater" data independently. By creating a pivot table, and filtering the data correctly, we saw a **higher** number of successful campaigns start in the middle of the year.

### We were also able to demonstrate the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on the monitary goal set. By using "countifs" formulas, we were able to extrapolate based on outcome and count the project outcomes per divided goal value. By then using the sum formula, the percenatge of each outcome was tallied and put into a visual chart. The order of coloumn values used in the countifs function is a key to getting the correct data, and some experimentation is neccessary to overcome this data obstacle. 

### Like the challenge with the order of coloumns in the countifs formula, editing and personalizing the charts can also be difficult. With new editions, and dealing with cross platform versions ( MAC and windows) remeberign how to edit colors, text, and formating inside the charts can be cumbersome. Relying on google and the limited help section within excel can ultimatley lead the user to the correct settings.

## Results
### With this limited comparison of the data, we can still infer that the largest number of succesful campaigns started in the middle of their  starting year, and that around sixty percent of all theater/play campings were succesful.

### We can also conclude that there was no real correlation between goal amount and the percenatge successful/failed.

### While this is a tertiary glance at the data, a deeper examination of the "theater/plays" variety to other theater campaigns or a broader comparison to all campaigns in select time frames may give a more discerable conclusion.
